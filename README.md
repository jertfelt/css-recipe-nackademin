This assignment was to create three recipes using CSS (responsive design not obligatory).
I wanted to explore the different settings and use responsiveness. 
Obligatory: 

Needed to use two fonts.
At least one picture per recipe, with alt text.
Three different headings.
One ol-list item
One ul-list item
Two external links
One section with facts about the recipe
Also it needed to be validated without any errors on https://validator.w3.org/
Two different backgroundcolors

For me, I'm using flexbox primarily. I experimented with position:relative in some parts, and also with full-width and half-width design.
