This assignment was to create three recipes using CSS (responsive design not obligatory).
Obligatory: needed to use two fonts.
I wanted to explore the different settings and use responsiveness. 
At least one picture per recipe, with alt text.
Three different headings.
One <ol>
One <ul<
Two external links
One section with facts about the recipe
Also it needed to be validated without any errors on https://validator.w3.org/
Two different backgroundcolors

For me, I'm using flexbox primarily. I experimented with position:relative in some parts, and also with full-width and half-width design.
