This assignment was to create three recipes using CSS (responsive design not obligatory). 
I made a mockup here: https://app.moqups.com/ZaHiGfdwwinDDdVthXiiBBMdb5gLg9Wz/view/page/ad64222d5
I was inspired to do this design after finding the two landscape photos, and then the square photo, as a 1:1 width and 1:2 column design.
I wanted to explore the different settings and use responsiveness. The measures are max-width 499px, 1200px and 899px) 
For the first two parts, I designed desktop first, for the last one I designed mobile first.
Obligatory: 

Needed to use two fonts.
At least one picture per recipe, with alt text.
Three different headings.
One ol-list item
One ul-list item
Two external links
One section with facts about the recipe
Also it needed to be validated without any errors on https://validator.w3.org/
Two different backgroundcolors

For me, I'm using flexbox primarily. I experimented with position:relative in some parts, but I haven't checked its responsiveness fully.
I also have experimented with styling the headers in different ways.
